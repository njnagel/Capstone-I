The opioid epidemic is responsible for the longest sustained decline in U.S. life expectancy since the time of World War I and the Great Influenza. In 2017, nearly 50,000 Americans died from an opioid overdose - with an estimated 2 million more living with opioid addiction every day. 

The data used for this project included multiple datasets consisting of opioid deaths, social indicators and populations.

The datasets included:
  - Counts of different types of opioid deaths for each state 
      
      Synthetic Opioids
      
      Natural, Semisynthetic 
      
      Methadone 
      
      Heroin
      
  - State populations 
  - Rates of uninsured 
  - Rates of immunization
  - Poverty rates 
  - Urban population
  
The datasets were merged on state name to produce the analytic data slab.  

Exploratory analysis of the data showed possible relationships between some of the factors, evident in the matrix of scatter plots.
